### Jeff Hammerbacher
1. Identify problem
2. Instrument data sources
3. Collect data
4. Prepare data (integrate, transform, clean, impute, ﬁlter, aggregate)
5. Build model
6. Evaluate model
7. Communicate results  

### Peter Huber
1. Inspection
2. Error checking
3. Modiﬁcation
4. Comparison
5. Modeling and model ﬁtting
6. Simulation
7. What-if analyses
8. Interpretation
9. Presentation of conclusions  

### Ben Fry
1. Acquire
2. Parse
3. Filter
4. Mine
5. Represent
6. Reﬁne
7. Interact 

### Dataists (Hilary Mason and friends)
1. Obtain
2. Scrub
3. Explore
4. Model (build a Model) - Write an equation or code that describes the process just based on the data
5. Interpret

### Hilary Mason's Advanced Machine Learning Video from O'reilly
"Today's approach to problem solving"
1. Motivation (understand the problem from human point of view
2. Look at realistic data (coming from real apis and web applications)
3. Explore the potential solutions (different algorithmic approaches)
4. Make the solution work

### Colin Mallows
0. Identify data to collect and its relevance to your problem
1. Statistical speciﬁcation of the problem
2. Method selection
3. Analysis of method
4. Interpret results for non-statisticians

### Jim Gray
1. Capture
2. Curate
3. Communicate

### Ted Johnson
1. Assemble an accurate and relevant data set
2. Choose the appropriate algorithm
